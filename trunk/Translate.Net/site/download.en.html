privacy policy explains how Translate.Net collects and uses information
about users of the official Translate.Net tool.&nbsp; It does not apply
to other author's websites, products or services.&nbsp; <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Types of Information</span><br><br>Because
Translate.Net emulate web browsers, Translate.Net sends certain
information to the websites and other network services when in
use.&nbsp; This information falls into three categories:<br><br><ul><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Personally-Identifying Information.</span>&nbsp;
"Personally-Identifying Information" means information that, without
the aid of additional information, can be directly associated with a
specific person or entity including but not limited to a name, phone
number or email address.&nbsp; Except as described below, author does
not collect or require end-users of Translate.Net to furnish
Personally-Identifying Information.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-Personally-Identifying Information.</span>&nbsp;
"Non-Personally-Identifying Information" means information that cannot
be directly associated with a specific person or entity.&nbsp;
Non-Personally-Identifying Information includes but is not limited to
your computer's configuration and version of Microsoft Internet
Explorer installed on your system.</li><li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Potentially Personally-Identifying Information.</span>&nbsp;
"Potentially Personally-Identifying Information" means information that
is Non-Personally-Identifying Information in and of itself but that
could be used in conjunction with other information to personally
identify you.&nbsp; This includes but is not limited to IP, your
queries and cookies. For example, Uniform Resource Locators ("URLs")
(the addresses of web pages) and Internet Protocol ("IP") addresses
(the addresses of computers on the internet), which are
Non-Personally-Identifying Information in and of themselves, could be
Personally-Identifying Information when combined with internet service
provider ("ISP") records.</li></ul><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Information Translate.Net Sends to Websites and other network services</span><br><br>When
function, Translate.Net sends information to the websites and other
network services by emulating&nbsp;web browsers and using Microsoft
Internet Explorer api, including (1) Non-Personally-Identifying
Information of the type that web browsers typically make available,
such as your language preference and the date and time of your visit;
and (2) Potentially Personally-Identifying Information such as your IP
address and Translate.Net related information (queries, subjects and
languages), cookies.&nbsp; This information may be logged on the
websites and network services.&nbsp; What information is logged and how
that information is used depends on the policies of each of the
websites and network service used.<br>Each website and network service
determines its own privacy policy for the distribution and use of this
Non-Personally-Identifying Information and
Potentially-Personally-Identifying Information.&nbsp; If you are
concerned about how a website or network service will use this
information, check out its privacy policy.&nbsp; <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Interactive Product Features</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Automated Update Service.</span>&nbsp;
Translate.Net's automatic update feature periodically checks to see if
an updated version of Translate.Net is available from author.&nbsp;
This feature sends Non-Personally-Identifying Information to author,
including the version of Translate.Net you are using. Author uses this
Non-Personally-Identifying Information to provide you with updated
versions of Translate.Net.&nbsp; Author do not collect or track any
Personally-Identifying Information or any information about the Web
sites or network services used, and author do not release the raw
information obtained from this feature to the public.&nbsp; Author may
release reports containing aggregate data.&nbsp; To prevent
Translate.Net from obtaining this information, you can turn this
feature off in Translate.Net's preferences.
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Cookies</span><br><br>A
cookie is a small string of information that a website stores on your
computer and that web browsers make available to that website each time
you return.&nbsp; Translate.Net uses cookies stores on your computer by
Microsoft Internet Explorer when requested to do so by websites only at
time when query results shown.&nbsp; A website uses cookies to help
identify and track visitors, the use of the website, and visitors'
website access preferences across multiple requests and visits. It is
possible to include Personally-Identifying Information, or references
to such information, in cookies, thereby enabling websites to track the
online movements of particular individuals. To prevent Translate.Net
from sending cookies to any website, configure Microsoft Internet
Explorer to disable cookies.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy Policy Changes</span><br><br>Author
may change the Translate.Net Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp;
Any and all changes will be reflected on this page.&nbsp; When author
changes this policy in a material way a notice will be posted on the
website at <a href="http://translateclient.googlepages.com">http://translateclient.googlepages.com</a>.&nbsp;Substantive
changes may also be announced through the other mechanisms like a
mailing list.&nbsp;It is your responsibility to ensure that you
understand the terms of this Privacy Policy.&nbsp; You should
periodically check this page for any changes to the current policy.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">For More Information</span><br><br>If you have questions about this privacy policy, please contact author at:&nbsp;<img alt="" src="email.png" align="top">.<br><br><div style="text-align: left;">This Privacy Policy is modified "Mozilla Firefox Privacy Policy" stored at <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-en.html">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/legal/privacy/firefox-en.html</a><br></div><br>
